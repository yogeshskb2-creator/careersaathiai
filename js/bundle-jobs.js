//   3. verification: "official-notice"  → you read the official notice/PDF yourself
//                    "news-reports"     → only seen in news/job sites (site shows "confirm")
//   4. Change LIST_UPDATED to today's date and run `npm test`.
//
// RULES: Only real notifications. Never guess dates. Always link the official website.
// The site works out "open / closing soon / upcoming / closed" from today's date
// on the visitor's own device, so nothing else needs changing when days pass.
